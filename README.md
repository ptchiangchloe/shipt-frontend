## React Github API Account Lookup Web App

![screenshot for readme](./readme.png)

<br />

### Challenge and Solution

This is the web application for Github API Account Lookup by entering Github user name. You can look up the GitHub user account information (user login name, user bio, user location, account followers and user's repositories). For the presentation of `Followers` section and  `Repository` section, There are 30 items for initial rendering. There are `LOAD MORE` buttons that you can load fetch next 30 items until no more items for the API. At the same time, the count number at the header of each section will turn into red.

It also has a responsive design that can be running in different size of screens.

The Demo Live version is hosted on Github pages. (Since it's a demo site, it has very stringent rate limits for API requests. If you receive 403 Forbidden message, please wait for a new rate limits update.)

### Techical Specs

This app is built by HTML5, Sass, ES6, Bable, webpack, React and React Router 4. It also uses material-ui and react-flexbox-grid for styling purpose.

All the code are generated by myself with extensive research and reasoning.(No boilerplates used)

The reason for using React js is because it's one of the most advanced front end UI frameworks. It uses virtual DOM to render the UI that improves the performance of UI rendering dramatically. It uses an algorithm called `DOM diff` to calculate all the changes in the Virtual DOM. Then it will only change the real DOM after the Virtual DOM figured out all the calculation.

Also, React is a component oriented library which can be very scalable and customizable. Because of its component-based, React component is a function, the state is the reference to its internal situation, props is the parameter.

For me, there is a lot of pleasure for writing react app. After an enough learning curve, I found very comfortable to write React because of its clean syntax, light API, and very stable component.
